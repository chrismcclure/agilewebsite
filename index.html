                    <h3 class="center margin-bottom"> My mission is to help you make those dreams a reality.  Work with me and I’ll use the skills I learned as a project manager at a software development company to help you attain your goals.</h3>
                    <p>As an Agile Goal Manager I will work with you to:</p>
                    <ul class="margin-bottom">
                        <li>Break down your big goals. Big goals seem unattainable but when they are broken down to small easy to accomplish goals, the process isn’t daunting. </li>
                        <li>Organize and prioritize your work. Together we’ll create a list of small tasks based on your goals that produce big results.</li>
                        <li>Focus and structure. Keep you focused each day by checking in on what you're working on and giving feedback.</li>
                        <li>Review and retrospective Analyze what you did good and what you did bad to aide in constant improvement.</li>
                        <li>Stay accountable. It’s easy to get off track and loose passion by yourself, but you’ll get much more done when you have someone to stay accountable to.</li>
                        <li>Overcome obstacles. There will always be challenges and working together we can plan and overcome them. </li>
                        <li>Enjoy your success. A teammate to share your success with each and every week. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ol class="margin-bottom">
                        <li>Fill out the form below. Name, email, and a short message to tell me what goals you want to accomplish.</li>
                        <li>I’ll contact you by email to set up a FREE 30 minute phone consultation and get some more information about your goals. This consultation is our chance to talk about your goals and determine if Agile Goal Development is right for you.</li>

                        <li>Then it’s on. Each day you have a specific detailed list of what needs to get done. I keep give feedback and tips on your todo list. I help you stay organized and on track to success. </li>

                    </p>
                    <p>What you’ll need:</p>

                        <li>Access to Google Doc, Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Sheets. All the documents we create together will be housed on Google. Then we both have easy quick access for reviewing and commenting.</li>
                        <li>A desire to get things done. This isn’t for everyone. Most people want stuff given to them. That’s not the way the world works. If you want something, you need to earn it. I keep my client list very short and only work with people who are willing to put in the work.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you try it out and it’s not for you, cancel at anytime. No contract!
